    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        {{ page.projectName }} offers automotive content, i.e., five different modules (sub-games), adapted to the player's age: the difficulty of the 
        modules are adapted to the player's age or only accessible to certain age categories.

    <h2>Main Tasks</h2>
    <ul>    
        <li>Definition of the project architecture and assets organization.</li>
        <li>Built many core functionalities, e.g., code used by multiple systems to locally store/read game data to/from the device's local storage, network 
            code to access web services.</li>
        <li>Developed the main module’s UI.</li>
        <li>
            Developed the following systems:
            <ul>
                <li>Localization.</li>
                <li>Scenes management and navigation.</li>
                <li>Screens and popups management and navigation.</li>
                <li>The client-side code of a remote configuration system, to remotely drive many aspects of the game (e.g., amount of points required to unlock 
                    the cars the player can drive, amount of points delivered by the questions of the in-game quiz).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Used various optimizations techniques to improve game performance.</li>   
        <li>Programmed the client-side of an in-house analytics system to send events to an analytics back-end server.</li>
        <li>
            Wrote the achievements system to manage and track users actions and the corresponding number of delivered points, e.g., the first time the player 
            finishes a race, she receives a defined number of points. Players can then use the earned points to unlock parts of the game. For instance, when 
            enough points are won, the player can unlock new cars.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Developed a racetracks builder tool for internal purposes. This enabled Staay employees to easily build racetracks and test many aspects 
                of the race module without the need to use the AR one. The latter is able to recognize physical racetracks made of hexagonal tiles and 
                generates data for the race module to create the virtual racetracks.

                        The player can build a racetrack using hexagonal tiles. The AR module is then able to recognize the individual physical tiles. 
                        The player can race with any of the unlocked cars on the virtual representation of the physical racetrack.

        <li>Wrote the code to check if the racetracks built either using the tracks builder or via the AR module is a valid one.</li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Built the system that dynamically generates virtual racetracks (environment, road, colliders, spawn points, mini map, etc.) based on the 
                track data generated either by the AR module, which is able to recognize physical racetracks made of hexagonal tiles, or the racetracks 
                builder tool.
