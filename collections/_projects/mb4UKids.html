<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>{{ page.projectName }} offers automotive content, i.e., five different modules (sub-games), adapted to the player's age: the difficulty of the modules are adapted 
    to the player's age or only accessible to certain age categories.</p>

<h2>Awards</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Best of Swiss Apps 2020 Mixed, Augmented & Virtual Reality – Gold</li>
    <li>Best of Swiss Apps 2020 User Experience & Usability – Gold</li>
    <li>Best of Swiss Apps 2020 Innovation – Silver</li>
    <li>Best of Swiss Apps 2020 Functionality – Silver</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Tasks</h2>
<ul>    
    <li>Definition of the project architecture and assets organization.</li>
    <li>Built many core functionalities, e.g., code used by multiple systems to locally store/read game data to/from the device's local storage, network 
        code to access web services.</li>
    <li>Developed the main module’s UI.</li>
    <li>
        Developed the following systems:
        <ul>
            <li>Localization.</li>
            <li>Scenes management and navigation.</li>
            <li>Screens and popups management and navigation.</li>
            <li>The client-side code of a remote configuration system, to remotely drive many aspects of the game (e.g., amount of points required to unlock 
                the cars the player can drive, amount of points delivered by the questions of the in-game quiz).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Used various optimizations techniques to improve game performance.</li>
    <li>Programmed the client-side of an in-house analytics system to send events to an analytics back-end server.</li>
    <li>Developed the algorithm to calculate the optimal path for the opponent cars’ AI.</li>
    <li>Wrote the achievements system to manage and track users actions and the corresponding number of delivered points, e.g., the first time the player 
        finishes a race, she receives a defined number of points. Players can then use the earned points to unlock parts of the game. For instance, when 
        enough points are won, the player can unlock new cars.</li>
    <li>Developed a tracks builder tool for internal purposes. This enabled Staay employees to easily build reacetracks and test many aspects of the race 
        module without the need to use the AR module. The latter is used to recognizes the physical track tiles and generates data used to build the 
        virtual tracks by the race module.</li>
    <li>Built the system to dynamically generate the virtual racetracks (environment, road, colliders, spawn points, mini map, etc.) based on the track 
        data generated when building the physical racetrack using the hexagonal tiles in the AR module.</li>
