    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the {{ page.projectName }} project is to offer a framework for real-time multiplayer action games. The {{ page.projectName }} offers 
        customizable server and client applications and APIs that can be easily re-used and adapted.

    <ul>
        <li>Definition of the project architecture and assets organization.</li>
        <li>
            Programmed the {{ page.projectName }} network engine: an in-house solution based on asynchronous sockets. The server runs on Windows, macOS or 
            Linux machines. The client API can be integrated into any Unity project.
        </li>
        <li>Developed a big part of the client UI.</li>
        <li>Built multiple core functionalities, e.g., network code to access web services.</li>
        <li>
            Developed the following systems:
            <ul>
                <li>Screens and popups management and navigation.</li>
                <li>The client-side code of a remote configuration system, to remotely drive many aspects of the game (e.g., players max speed, acceleration 
                    and mass).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
