    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        {{ page.projectName }} is a merge game developed for Migros, Switzerland's largest retail company. The player merges 3 or more items together to 
        create new or improved ones of a higher tier. This mechanic is used to solve hundred of puzzles (also called levels), to improve the player's own 
        village and to participate to multiple contests where players can win Migros coupons and gift cards.

    <h2>Main Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed the game store, where players can browse and buy items with the in-game currency earned by completing levels (i.e. solving puzzles by 
            merging objects together).
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Created the first three valleys. The valleys are long 3D landscapes the user can scroll through to select the levels to be played. Each valley 
                has a unique theme, is set on a different epoch and contains dozens of levels. This task required importing large amount of content created by 
                the graphical designers, organize it within the Unity project, create prefabs (a way to make game content easily re-usable) and use the 
                prefabs to build the valleys.
            </p>

                        alt="Picture presenting three valleys. Each valley has a unique theme (summer, winter, and fall) and epoch.">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Valleys have a unique theme and are set at different epochs. Each valley contains 
                        dozens of level to be played.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Wrote multiple surface shaders optimized for mobile devices. All the materials applied on the valleys’ 3d content are base on those shaders.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a solution similar to the Unity Addressable Asset System to manage online stored game content that can be dynamically loaded at runtime 
            when required. The solution covers the aspects of organizing, packaging, storing online, downloading, caching and loading game content. The 
            {{ page.projectName }} valleys are built with it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Created the UI part that displays to the player the available valleys and that allows her to select which valley to navigate to.
        </li>
        <li>
            Created the UI part displaying the quests and weekly challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Integrated the Migros account system so that users can participate to weekly challenges and play the game on multiple devices or restore the 
            game progress on a new device (the game progress is saved on backend servers).
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Implemented a solution to download and decode compressed textures stored on the backend servers.</p>

            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Integrated a 3rd party solution to display advertisements and web content via a webview.
        </li>
        <li>
            Used various optimizations techniques to improve game performance.
        </li>
