    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        {{ page.projectName }} is a merge game developed for Migros, Switzerland's largest retail company. The player merges 3 or more items together to 
        create new or improved ones of a higher tier. This mechanic is used to solve hundred of puzzles (also called levels), to improve the player's own 
        village and to participate to multiple contests where players can win Migros coupons and gift cards.
