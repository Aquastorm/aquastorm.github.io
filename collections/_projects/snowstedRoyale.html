<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>{{ page.projectName }} is a 2D real-time multiplayer shooter game. Players can fight PvP battles alone or with friends in one of the three offered game modes: 
    death match, capture the flag or battle royale.</p>

<h2>Main Tasks</h2>
<ul>    
    <li>Developed most of the menu UI and developed a few components and screens of the in-game one.</li>
    <li>Created multiple reusable and configurable controls and widgets (UI components).</li>
    <li>Built many core functionalities, e.g., code used by multiple systems to locally store/read game data to/from the device's local storage, network 
        code to access web services.</li>
    <li>
        Developed the following systems:
        <ul>
            <li>Localization.</li>
            <li>Screens and popups management, navigation & animation.</li>
            <li>Screens' tabs management & associated animations.</li>
            <li>The client-side code of a remote configuration system, to remotely drive many aspects of the game (e.g., duration and amount of players 
                for every game mode, weapons damage and range, players walking and running speed).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Programmed the shop module, where the player can buy items with the in-game currency.</li>
    <li>Programmed the user profile module, where the player can buy items to customize her avatar.</li>
    <li>Used various optimizations techniques to improve game performance.</li>
    <li>Optimzed the game so that it can run on low-end devices.</li>
    <li>
        Integrated the following SDKs: 
        <ul>
            <li>Google Firebase SDKs: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Firebase Dynamic Links.</li>
            <li>GameAnalytics SDK to collect core and customized metrics.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Developed a solution to resize textures that are bigger than what the GPU can handle by doing bilinear filtering on the CPU using the C# Job System 
        and the Burst compiler.</li>
</ul>
