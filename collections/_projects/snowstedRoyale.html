    <h2>Main Tasks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Created multiple reusable and configurable controls and widgets (UI components).</li>    
        <li>
            <p>Developed most of the menu UI and developed a few components and screens of the in-game one.</p>
            <div class="screenshot-center">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/Snowsted_Hub_c.jpg" width="800" height="450"
                        alt="The main screen, where one can access all game features. In the mid of the screen the player can see her customized avatar.">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">{{ page.projectName }}'s main screen displays the player customized avatar. The menu UI 
                        is animated when transitioning between the different screens.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            Built many core functionalities, e.g., code used by multiple systems to locally store/read game data to/from the device's local storage, network 
            code to access web services.
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed the following systems:
            <ul>
                <li>Localization.</li>
                <li>Screens and popups management, navigation & animation.</li>
                <li>Screens' tabs management & associated animations.</li>
                <li>
                    The client-side code of a remote configuration system, to remotely drive many aspects of the game (e.g., duration and amount of players 
                    for every game mode, weapons damage and range, players walking and running speed).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Programmed the shop module, where the player can buy items (e.g., medkits, smoke grenades and shots of different colors) with the in-game 
            currency.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Programmed the user profile module, where the player can buy items to customize her avatar.</p>
            <div class="screenshot-center">
                <figure class="figure">
                    <img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="/assets/images/projects/Snowsted_ProfileClothing_c.jpg" width="800" height="450"
                        alt="Displays clothes that can be bought with the in-game currency to customize the player avatar.">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The player can buy different items (e.g., masks, caps and suits) with the in-game currency 
                        to personalize her avatar.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>Used various optimizations techniques to improve game performance.</li>
        <li>Optimized the game so that it can run on low-end devices.</li>
        <li>
            Integrated the following SDKs: 
            <ul>
                <li>Google Firebase SDKs: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Firebase Dynamic Links.</li>
                <li>GameAnalytics SDK to collect core and customized metrics.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Developed a solution to resize textures that are bigger than what the GPU can handle by doing bilinear filtering on the CPU using the C# Job System 
            and the Burst compiler.</li>
    </ul>
