<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>I'm developing games on PC, but most of what we develop at Staay needs to also run iOS. Thus, I often need to test what I'm developing on a real
    iOS device. So my typicall workflow was to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>push the last changes to the Git repository</li>
    <li>walk to a Mac machine and login</li>
    <li>pull the changes from Git</li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
</ul>
