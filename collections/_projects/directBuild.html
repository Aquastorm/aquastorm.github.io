<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The orignal idea of this project was to solve an inefficiency in the development workflow: developers working on Windows machines couldn't build and 
    deploy games for the iOS (and iPadOS) on their machines. For legal reasons, code for iOS can only be built on a Mac. Thus, developer that wanted to 
    test even a little code change, had to go trough a manual, error prone and lengthy process, involving, among other things, to find a free Mac and 
    physically go there to build their games.
    With {{ page.projectName }}, every manual step has been automated and developers can now continue working on their projects while letting a remote Mac 
    machine build and deploy their games on iOS devices.
    The original concept was then extended to support:
    <ul>
        <li>Remote builds and deployments for the Android platform.</li>
        <li>Publishing of the built games to Google Play and the Apple App Store.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Main Tasks</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Developed the original idea and a small proof of concept during my free time. Eventually asked if Staay management was interested in such a 
        product and received the ok to further develop it during my working time.
    </li>
    <li>Responsible to write the whole solution, which comprises server and client code, and guaranteed that the server application was always up and 
        running.</li>
    <li>Extended the Unity Editor to integrate the {{ page.projectName }} client within the Unity development environment. The client is distributed in 
        form of a Unity package so that it can easily be added to any Unity project.</li>
    <li>Wrote the end user and admin documentations to explain respectively how to use {{ page.projectName }} and how to configure the infrastructure 
        required by the {{ page.projectName }} server in order to operate.</li>
    <li>Ensured that every project could be built with {{ page.projectName }} and supported other team members with the automation of manual build-related 
        activities. Reason: some projects required additional manual build steps in order to be built, mainly due to the integration of 3rd parties SDKs or 
        libraries. The modification of the info.plist for iOS games is a common case.</li>
</ul>
