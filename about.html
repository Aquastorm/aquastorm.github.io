        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            From my childhood onwards, I have been fascinated by video games and started wondering how they are created. The attraction to this medium 
            pushed me to write my first lines of code during primary school, nourishing my passion for video games and computer science.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge on the multiple facets of software development by working as developer, 
            software architect, technical lead, scrum master, product owner and project manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            Achieving a strong technical background helped me taking the lead and responsibility for a great number of projects. 
            I sharpened my solid leadership and management skills by:
            <ul>
                <li>Overseeing multi-location projects and teams ranging from a few dozens to a few hundred of people.</li>
                <li>Repeatedly taking the responsibility to ramp-up/set-up teams.</li>
                <li>Helping projects that werenâ€™t working well to get back on track.</li>
                <li>Establishing processes, guidelines and development strategies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2007, thanks to my deep knowledge of Agile software development methodologies, I promoted the use of Scrum, Kanban and XP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since 2018, I have been living my dream of working in the video game industry.
