        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            From my childhood onwards, I have been fascinated by video games and started wondering how they are created. The attraction to this medium 
            pushed me to write my first lines of code during primary school, nourishing my passion for video games and computer science.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge on the multiple facets of software development by working as developer, 
            software architect, technical lead, scrum master, product owner and project manager.        
        </p>
        <p>
            Since October 2018, I have been living my dream of working in the video game industry.
